You are a senior frontend developer helping me bootstrap a small project.

Goal
    Build a very simple flashcards web app that will run as a Home Screen App (PWA) on iPhone.

Constraints

    No backend

    No AI or LLM inside the app

    No frameworks (no React, Vue, etc.)

    Use plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only

    Mobile-first design

    Clean, readable code

App behavior (v1)

    Show one flashcard at a time

    Each flashcard has a question and an answer

    Tap the card to flip between question and answer

    “Previous” and “Next” buttons to navigate cards

    Reset card to question when navigating

Project setup

    Use the following files:

        index.html

        style.css

        app.js

        manifest.json

    No build tools, no bundlers

How to proceed

    Start by explaining the minimal file structure and responsibilities of each file

    Then generate the initial version of index.html only

    Do NOT generate CSS or JavaScript yet

    Keep everything optimized for iPhone Safari

When ready, create index.html in this folder.
